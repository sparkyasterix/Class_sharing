1 Logistic Regression
Is it going to rain in Boise today? Create a Jupyter Notebook at that performs Logistic
Regression using scikit-learn to predict the answer to this yes/no question.
(a) Find some data You’re looking for a data set that has historic weather data for
Boise, Idaho. Search for one yourself, that’s part of the assignment! There are
many websites that offer APIs or searches that allow free downloads of a given
time range and location. Select at least one year (maybe more) of recent weather
data. A good data set will have things like temperature, barometric pressure,
wind speed, etc. And of course, it must have some indication about whether it
rained that day, usually in the form of inches of precipitation.
(b) Pull this data into your project Download the data, and import it into your
project as a file. Perhaps using Pandas and import it as a CSV file? You may
have to create a new column indicating the label: 0 = no rain, 1 = rain. This
column is an important part of the training process. It’s not a feature, it’s a
label for that given vector.
(c) Use Logistic Regression You’re trying to answer the question, “Is it going to
rain today in Boise?” Train a model that tries to predict if it’s going to rain on
a given day. The “day” is a vector/row/array/sample of given features that you
feed into the model to get a prediction. Remember, you need the same number
of features (columns) for a given prediction that you used to train the model.
(d) How good is your model? Is it better than a wild guess? Document your
findings in the notebook.
(e) Push Jupyter Notebook to github
