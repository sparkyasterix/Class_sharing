1 Linear Regression with scikit-learn
scikit-learn has done more to make Python the language of choice for ML than any other
library (except maybe numpy). It’s used in academia, and we use it in industry. It’s worth
your time to get to know scikit-learn, and how to read its documentation.
In this assignment, you will create a Jupyter notebook from scratch, and use scikit-learn
to create a Linear Regression model.

(a) Browse the scikit-learn documentation https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

(b) Use this data:
data = ‘GPA’: [3.0, 3.7, 3.3, 2.5, 4.0, 3.2, 3.9, 3.0], ‘Hours Studied’:
[2, 8, 3, 1, 12, 7, 9, 5]

(c) Create a Linear Regression model with the scikit-learn library Create
a new Jupyter notebook, import scikit-learn, and implement linear regression
using the LinearRegression().fit function. Make sure to output the accuracy
of your model.

(d) Push Jupyter Notebook to github If you don’t already have a personal
GitHub account, please create one and learn how to use it (clone, add, commit,
push). Add me as a contributor to your account so I can see your code. My
GitHib account is ckennington.
